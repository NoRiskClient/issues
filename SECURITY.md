## Private Reporting

Even though we always try to minimize potential security risks, it can still happen that a vulnerability occurs. If you discover a security vulnerability in the NoriskClient and everything related to it, we encourage you to privately report it to our development team following the steps below. This helps us address and resolve the issue before potential exploitation.

## Why private Reporting?

Private reporting is crucial for handling security issues discreetly. It prevents potential attackers from exploiting vulnerabilities before a fix is implemented. This approach allows us to prioritize the security of our users and the community.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please use the ticket system in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/XbsUwHxzQN) server to create a report. The report should include a detailed description of the vulnerability. If possible please include steps to reproduce the issue, potential impact and any relevant information which could be helpful for us in every way. 
Thank you for helping us ensure the security.
